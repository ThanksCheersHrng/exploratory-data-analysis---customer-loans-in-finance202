    "So many of the distributions of these columns struck me as Non-Gaussian to begin with (e.g. exponential or poisson could fit a lot of this data, since we are literally counting \"how many accounts have this quality?\" and the number of accounts accrues as time passes.), so the concept of using 1.5*IQR as the defining \"distance from the quartile\" for outliers (which is what sbn.boxplot() does) may not be appropriate. If I see a boxplot has 50 \"outliers,\" they're not really outliers, are they?

    "*total_rec_int - there's one that's probably a couple hundred higher than the rest, but the tapering of frequencies shown in this plot suggests another poisson. \n",

    "total_accounts - I could consider removing the 5 that are about 85-ish, or just the 2 that are above 90. There's still evidence of tapering which calls the legitimacy of dropping outliers into question. \n",
    "\n",
    "open_accounts - clearly discrete dta, with 5 above 45 and 2 above 50, and the thickness of the circles indicates tapering, i.e. a poisson-style distribution. As the values are all fairly close to each other, I wouldn't be inclined to remove any of those. \n",
    "\n",
    "*inq_last_6mths - the four above 22 are quite 'gapped' away from the rest, especially the three above 30. \n",
