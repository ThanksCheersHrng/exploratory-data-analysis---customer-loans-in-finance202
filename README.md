# exploratory-data-analysis---customer-loans-in-finance202


This repo is for another Ai Core Project titled "Exploratory Data 
Analysis - Customer Loands in Finance." I've been looking forward to 
seeing what examples of finance questions they put together, hoping that 
eventually the projects will build towards some DL project looking for 
market trends (as an example). Some serious maths!

Let's see where this project takes us, shall we?
